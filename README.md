# atom-based_uncertainty_model

The atom-based uncertainty model is based on the molecule-based uncertainty model from: https://github.com/gscalia/chemprop/tree/uncertainty


The atom-based uncertainty quantification method provides an extra layer of explainability to both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, i.e., one can analyze individual atomic uncertainty values to diagnose the chemical component that introduces the uncertainty in the prediction.
